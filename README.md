# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code


The project is a work in progress. The purpose of creating a Weather Dashboard through the browser is to help users figure out the 5-day forecast for any city they search for. This application was created with creating files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The content of the page has a search bar to search for their city, and once the cityâ€™s been searched for, the 5-day weather forecast should appear on the page. The deployed application can be found here: https://codeandlift706.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/.


## Installation
VS Code to create and manipulate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the application through the web browser. GitHub for version control and web page deployment.
