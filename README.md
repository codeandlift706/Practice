## Description
The purpose of creating a Weather Dashboard through the browser is for users to retrieve the current weather and the 5-day forecast for any city they search for. The page has a search bar to search for their city, and on click, the 5-day weather forecast renders on the page. Users can view previously searched cities by clicking on them and clear the list with the “clear” button. The deployed application can be found here: https://codeandlift706.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/.


## Installation
VS Code to create and manipulate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the application through the web browser. GitHub for version control and web page deployment.
Bootstrap CSS Framework CDN included via CDN: https://getbootstrap.com/.


## Usage
This can be used whenever users need a weather forecast application.

## Contribution
The coding (variables, conditional statements, fetch formulas, console logs, functions) -all the additions- that were made to the web page are credited to the curriculum taught in the UCI coding boot camp. The AskBCS learning assistant helped provide guidance with the city buttons and weather icon. A tutor of the boot camp also helped with filtering the API data.
